What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
- The difference between getElementById & getElementsByClassName is that getElementById is used for selecting a unique element by an id and getElementsByClassName is used for selecting multiple elements by their classnames. Again querySelector is used to get the first element using css selector but querySelectorAll is used for selecting all the matched elements by any css selector like #id and .class.
